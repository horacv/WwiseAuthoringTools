# Wwise Authoring Tools

A collection of tools and scripts for Wwise 

## Overview

This repository contains scripts for the Wwise Authoring Tool.\
The purpose of these scripts is to automate some tasks in the editor to personalize and improve the workflow.

Each script contains information about what it does as comments.

## How to use

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install the required packages by running **Add-ons/install_dependencies.sh**
3. Copy the `Add-ons` folder into your Wwise project

There are several ways to integrate these scripts into your Wwise project.\
The easiest way is to copy the `Add-ons` folder inside your project.

Your project will then load the scripts automatically the next time you open it.\
Alternatively, if your project is already open go to the top right search bar and type `>Command Add-ons/Reload`.
